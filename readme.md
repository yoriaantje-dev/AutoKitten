## Dependecies:
This program depens on the website: *https://placekitten.com*

#### To use:
All you need to do, is clone this GIT using the clone or download button and hitting ZIP. 

Then unzip the folder, and either run the included *batch-file* **_(AutoKitten.bat)_** 
or open the script *AutoKitten.py* directly in python, and run that.

You can also use the *AutoKittenUpdate.py* for more direct changing of only the background, as it will not give you the option menu 

Windows Blocks the Batch script which you will need to run, in order to get around this block, you need to press *more info* 
and then an option to press *run anyway will* show up at the bottom.
